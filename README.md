Technical matter


At the moment, this is just for mechanical inventions. 

There will be categories - if nothing is selected, it will select all of them - each with their own subcategories.

Also a searchbox, so someone can type in "donut straight edges" (classic nut description) and hopefully it will return polygons and torus and aperture.

Finally, there will be a "search" button - this takes any categories or search terms as an input and returns all related words.

Eventually, I think each word will need a definition or a picture, so might deserve its own page. This will require a webserver and possibly an immutable database. Need to check whether that's something GitHub pages supports. But also, I could do this with just javascript.
